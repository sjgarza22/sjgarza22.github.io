I took a mistep and found myself on the ground. Like a turtle on it's back, I couldn't seem to get back on my feet. One day of missing assignments turned into two, then one week turned into two. I tried catching up, and I thought I was doing a good job of it, but then came the day of my Portfolio Project presentation. I thought I was prepared, but my mind went blank after every question that was asked. I knew what was being asked, but I couldn't think of the terms or any words to explain the concepts.

A month has passed, but now I'm back. I fell, and if I fall again, I will use every resource available to me to get back on my feet. I don't plan on staying on the ground.

I talked with my educational coach the other day and told her the story of what pushed me to pursue an education in Software Engineering. Coading has been a part of my life on and off since high school. I think I only let go of pursuing a Computer Science because I didn't know what I wanted to do with that degree. After I created that small program for work last year though, I know that what I want to do with my coding skills is to create applications that will help small and medium size buisnesses succeed and grow.

Anyway, I'm back ya'll.
