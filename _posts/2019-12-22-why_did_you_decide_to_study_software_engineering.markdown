Earlier this year I wrote a small program for work using PHP and a Rest API. It was the first time I had ever written something outside of a classroom, and boy, what a rush! The closest I can put into word how I felt at that moment was when I was ten and went camping with my class. Our cabin leader took us out onto a field one night and I saw for the first time the milky way. All those stars.

Writing that program made me want to truely get back into software engineering. I enjoy the feeling of creating something out of nothing more than a handful of words. The potential of what can be created with prgramming is like all those stars in the sky. Innumerable and ever expanding.

I'm not entirely sure where this path will take me, but I'm excited to begin this journey with all of you.
